## Description

Biblioseek, the Library Management System is a Python project utilizing Tkinter and PIL libraries. This project is a web-based application that allows users to log in, search for books, view book details, and provide feedback for books they have read. Users can search for books by entering the book name and author, and the system will display information about the book if it is present in the database. If the book is not found, a message indicating its absence will be shown.

The system also includes a feedback feature, where users can view feedback provided by previous readers for a particular book. Users can also submit their own feedback after reading a book, which will be stored in the system and made available for others to view as recommendations.
